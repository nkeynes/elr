Plan for v1.0
-------------

Useability
* Add command-line flags for varying levels of debug output.
* Better parser conflict debug output
* Better error reporting
* Named vars could be nice

Performance
* Implement comb-vector algorithm as per the dragon book
    - Get a copy of the dragon book
* Optimize skeleton code, try to get performance to within epsilon of
      bison/flex.
* Test generator performance with larger grammars

Features
* Implement EBNF parser
    - see nakata/sassa paper, etc
* Implement minimal-state LR(1)
    - see pager, spector
* Case-insensitive lexical support
* Option to disable conflict resolution
* Implement more advanced regular expression support. In particular:
    - group counts ( a{n,m} )
    - start of line/end of line ( ^, $ )
    - named character classes (eg [[:alpha:]])
* Additional backslash types:
    - \x34 (hex char)
    - \0377 (octal char)
    - \0 (null)
* Unicode?

Testing
* Unit tests
    - framework?
* System test cases
